<!--First Angularjs. Model is here by default.  -->

<!-- THERE IS NO JAVASCRIPT -->


<!-- Angular uses a bootstrapping process where it compiles the DOM. This allows the DOM to
    be given new functionality. The ng-app directive I think is the directive the causes it
    to be compiled thereby creating an Angular API-->

<!--the ng-app makes this an angular directive. -->
<html ng-app>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Angular.js Example</title>
    <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular.js/1.2.1/angular.min.js"></script>

<!-- This is using the ng-model DIRECTIVE on the input element. This tells input data should be bound to the
    name property on the angular model - which is called the root scope. SO the contents of the text field
    on the DOM that is after Name: is bound to the $scope that is shared between the html and the angular model. It
    is like a backBone model where you can listen for changes and you can change it and the changes with
    porpagate-->
Name:<input ng-model="name" type="text"/>

<!-- so the double handlebars below tell the angular compiled app to update the html template to the name
    property of the angular model. This is called data binding. It is bound to the model and the template.-->
Hello {{name}}
